# Breath of Fire Text Editor
Extractor and markup intermediary for editing text sections found in Breath of Fire III and IV.

## Installing
The current grammar, to put it nicely, sucks, and requires the Earley parser (worst case complexity of O(nÂ³)) to run. To mitigate this, you might want to use a faster implementation of Python, such as PyPy. The instructions below should be ignored while I come up with an installation method for PyPy.
1. ~~Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)~~
2. ~~When installing Python, make sure that "Add Python 3.xx" is ticked~~
3. ~~Open a command prompt window~~
4. Type `python -m pip install git+https://github.com/glitch-in-the-herring/bof-text-editor`

## Usage
### Extractor
To obtain the markup representation of the text section in an .EMI file, run:
```
bof-text extract FILENAME [-o OUT]
```
The argument `-o` specifies the optional output filename.

### Editor
The editor lets you patch an existing .EMI file or output the translated text section into a separate binary file. To patch an existing .EMI file, make sure that the correct filename is specified in the `%TARGET` variable, and run:

```
bof-text edit FILENAME [-c]
```
The argument `-c` is an optional flag that tells the editor to perform the patch on a copy instead of the original file.

To create a new binary file, run:
```
bof-text edit FILENAME -n
```
